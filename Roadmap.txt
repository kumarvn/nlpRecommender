Creating an NLP based movie recommender

# Create a movies database with sqlite3
# Insert movie information acquired from the iMDB API
# Filter plots by genres
# create a bag of words for each genre
# Build a topic signature using chi-squared test of association
# Merge genres which are similar, as determined by co-sine similarity
# Compare movies which are similar based on co-sine similarity of genre scores
# Build a static website with a sign-up form, a page to enter movie and an output page which shows the recommended movie posters
